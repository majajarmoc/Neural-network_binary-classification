# Neural-network_binary-classification

One of the many available machine learning techniques commonly used in the process of chemical hazard assessment is the neural network algorithm. The effectiveness of the results obtained based on artificial neural network models is determined by hyperparameters, the tuning (selection) of which can sometimes pose problems.  The topic of my thesis was to evaluate the effect of changing the hyperparameters of a neural network on the effectiveness of a model predicting acute toxicity induced by the presence of structurally diverse organic compounds against a species of Daphnia paddlefish, such as Daphnia magna.
Within the framework of my own research, I developed classification models of chemical structure-biological activity relationships (binary classifier) based on the method of neural networks using different hyperparameters (including different neuron activation functions, number of hidden layers and number of neurons in a layer). Based on a comparative analysis of the obtained results, I defined the optimal (for the analyzed dataset) combination of hyperparameters that offers the most correct classification of compounds due to induced acute toxicity to D. magna.
